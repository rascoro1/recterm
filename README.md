### Motivation

The [`ttyrec`] tool is a wonderful way to record and share terminal sessions and [`ttygif`] is a awesome way to turn them into gifs. However I would like to record videos of the terminal that include audio so giving an email of instuctions using mp4 would be the best way for me.

### Usage

```bash
$ recterm <outputname-do not include the .mp4>
```

Example:

```bash
$ recterm test_terminal_session
```
The .wav and .mp4 file will be generated in the 'test_terminal_session' directory. In your current working directy the final .mp4 will be present with the file name test_terminal_session.mp4

### Requirements

#### OS X

```bash
# Requires Homebrew installed. Find it at http://brew.sh/.
$ brew install ttyrec ttygif sox ffmpeg
```

#### Ubuntu

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install imagemagick ttyrec gcc x11-apps make git
$ git clone https://github.com/icholy/ttygif.git
$ cd ttygif
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ apt-get install sox ffmpeg
```

```
